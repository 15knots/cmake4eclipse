	<h1>Project Builders</h1>
	<p>The Cmake4eclipse plugin provides the following <strong>Project Builders</strong>
	(selectable in the <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.user/reference/cdt_u_prop_build_toolchain.htm">
	Tool Chain Editor tab</a>):</p>
	<h3 id="portable">CMake Builder</h3>
	  <p>This builder allows you to customize the build output location 
    and makes CMake generate the build scripts. 
  </p>
	<p>The builder retrieves the name of the actual build tool from the cache file written
	by cmake during build-script-generation.
