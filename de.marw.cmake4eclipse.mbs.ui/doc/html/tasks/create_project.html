  <h1>Creating a Project</h1>
  <p>First of all: Do not try to manually generate an Eclipse project using <kbd>cmake -G Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles</kbd>
  and import it, as that will make cmake4eclipse unavailable in your project!
  </p>
  <p>As a first start, you may want to try one of the 
  <a href="https://github.com/15knots/cmake4eclipse-sample-projects">example projects</a>.
  </p>
  <p>As of cmake4eclipse version 4, the plugin comes with a project creation wizard of its own.<p>
   <a href="create_project_cmake4eclipse.html">Create</a> a <em>Cmake4eclipse Managed Build</em> project.
   </p>
  <p>A <em>Cmake4eclipse Managed Build</em> project is essentially the same as a <em>Managed Build</em> project. Since cmake4eclipse
  takes the user`s <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> files as the source of truth &#8212; in contrast to <em>Managed Build</em>
  which uses the data entered in lots of project property pages &#8212; a <em>Cmake4eclipse Managed Build</em> project
  does only display the project property pages and tabs that effect cmake`s buildscript generation; in the hope of
  reducing end user`s confusion.
