	<h1>Project Builders</h1>
	<p>The Cmake4eclipse plugin provides the following <strong>Project Builders</strong>
	(selectable in the <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.user/reference/cdt_u_prop_build_toolchain.htm">
	Tool Chain Editor tab</a>):</p>
	<h3 id="portable">CMake Builder</h3>
	  <p>This builder allows you to customize the build output location 
    and makes CMake generate the build scripts. 
  </p>
	<p>The builder retrieves the name of the actual build tool from the cache file written
	by cmake during build-script-generation.
</p>
<p>
This is the recommended builder.
</p>
<h3 id="make">CMake Builder (deprecated)</h3>
  <p>
    This builder is nearly identical to the <i>Gnu Make Builder</i> that comes with CDT.
    It requires that cmake is configured to generate <i>makefiles</i> and will invoke the <code>make</code> tool
    found in the system's executable search path ($PATH) to build the project.<br>
    It is kept only for backward compatibility with projects set up with cmake4eclipse prior to version 2.0.0
    and cannot be selected in the UI any longer.
