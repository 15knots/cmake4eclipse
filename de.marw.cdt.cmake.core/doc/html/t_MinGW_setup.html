  <h2>Setup tips for MinGW on Windows</h2>
  <h3>The Problem</h3>
  <p>
    When generating the build scripts, cmake on Windows looks for MinGW`s
    compilers and other tools in a fixed location (<code>C:\MinGW</code>) and on
    the directories specified in the <code>PATH</code> environment variable.<br>Since
    many users do not have the MinGW tools in <code>PATH</code>, cmake fails to
    generate the build scripts in this case.
  </p>
  <h3>A Proposed Solution</h3>
  <p>
    In short: Make sure the cmake process invoked by cmake4eclipse is given a <code>PATH</code>
    environment variable that includes the file system location of the MinGW
    tools.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Solution for <a href="https://mingw-w64.org/">mingw-w64</a>
  </h3>
  <p>NOTE that adapted versions of the solution proposed below might also
    work for MSYS, Cygwin and Visual Studio tools. Please report back if you
    find it is working.</p>
  <p>
    For the following, we assume that mingw-w64 is installed in directory <code>C:\Programs\mingw64</code>.
  </p>
  <p>The proposed Eclipse workspace and project setup steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Define an Eclipse-internal environment variable that points to your
      mingw-w64 installation root; either in the workspace scope or the project
      scope:
      <ol type="A">
        <li>Workbench: Open the <b>Window &#10146; Preferences &#10146;
            C/C++ &#10146; Build &#10146; Environment page</b></li>
        <li>Project scope: Open the <b>Project &#10146; Properties
            &#10146; C/C++ Build &#10146; Environment</b> page
        </li>
      </ol>Then add a variable named <kbd>MINGW_ROOT</kbd> for your mingw-w64
      installation root directory; specify <kbd>C:\Programs\mingw64</kbd> as the
      value in this case.
    </li>
    <li>Augment the PATH environment variable that gets passed to cmake:<br>For
      your project, open the <b>Project &#10146; Properties &#10146; C/C++
        Build &#10146; Environment</b> page. Add a variable named <code>PATH</code>
      and set its value to <kbd>${PATH};${MINGW_ROOT}/bin</kbd> (verbatim).
    </li>
    <li>Close the dialog and re-build the project.</li>
  </ol>
