	<h1>Preprocessor Include Paths, Macros, etc.</h1>
	<P>Include paths and preprocessor macros for the C/C++ indexer are supplied by
	<strong>Language Settings Providers</strong> using 
	<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.user/concepts/cdt_c_scanner_discovery.htm">Scanner Discovery</a> mechanism.
	</P>
	<p>The CMake for CDT plugin provides these <strong>Settings Providers</strong>:</p>

	<h3>CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS Parser</h3>
	<p>This provider instructs CMake to generate a file that contains the compiler commands-lines
	which will be executed when a project is build.
	It parses that file and provides the preprocessor include paths, macros definitions and 
	macros undefines to the indexer. 
	Parsing is done at most once per build since the cache is invalidated when the
	file`s time-stamp is newer, so it should be reasonably fast.
	</p>
	
	<h3>CMake Build Output Parser (deprecated)</h3>
	<p>
	<strong>Do not use, it will be removed in future versions.</strong> 
	It is just my first implementation of a<code>LanguageSettingsProvider</code>.<br>
	This provider parses each line of the build output and tries to find compiler command-lines.
	To do so, it instructs CMake to generate build scripts that produce verbose build output.	
	As a cause, it will not work with the <code>ninja</code> build tool, because ninja builds do not print any
	compiler command lines by default.<br>
	Build output parsing degrades build performance, so this provider tries to cache its 
	findings -- unfortunately its caching is somehow unreliable.
