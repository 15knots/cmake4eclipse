	<h1>Preprocessor Include Paths, Macros, etc.</h1>
	<P>Include paths and preprocessor macros for the C/C++ indexer  are supplied by
	<strong>Language Settings Providers</strong> using 
	<a href="../concepts/cdt_c_scanner_discovery.htm">Scanner Discovery</a> mechanism.
	</P>
	<p>The CMake for CDT plugin provides these <strong>Settings Providers</strong>:</p>

	<h3>CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS Parser</h3>
	<p>This provider instructs CMake to generate a file that contains the compiler commands-lines
	which will be executed when a project is build.
	It parses that file and provides the preprocessor include paths, macros definitions and 
	macros undefines to the indexer. 
	Parsing is done at most once per build since the cache is invalidated when the
	file`s time-stamp is newer, so it should be reasonably fast.
	</p>

	<h3>CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS Parser SFN-proof</h3>
	<p>This provider basically acts the same as the provider above, but it has a workaround for a 
	<a href="https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/issues/16138">bug in CMake under windows</a>.
	That bug produces <em>short file names</em> (like <code>AVR-G_~1.EXE</code>). The 
 	provider mentioned above cannot recognize these	file names as a
	C-compiler name	or a C++ compiler name.<br>
	The workaround transforms file names to their long representation but this comes with some
	build performance penalty.<br>
	You would <strong>only need this provider, if and only if</strong>
	<ul>
	 <li>You intend to run the build under windows, and</li>
  	 <li>your version of cmake has the bug mentioned above, and</li>
  	 <li>the absolute file system path pointing to one of the compiler-executables (/C, C++)
  	 on your machines might contain <strong>whitespace characters</strong>.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>See <a href="https://github.com/15knots/cmake4eclipse/issues/31">issue #31</a>.
	</p>
	
	<h3>CMake Build Output Parser (deprecated)</h3>
	<p>
	<strong>Do not use, it will be removed in future versions.</strong> 
	It is just my first implementation of a<code>LanguageSettingsProvider</code>.<br>
	This provider parses each line of the build output and tries to find compiler command-lines.
	To do so, it instructs CMake to generate build scripts that produce verbose build output.	
	As a cause, it will not work with the <code>ninja</code> build tool, because ninja builds do not print any
	compiler command lines by default.<br>
	Build output parsing degrades build performance, so this provider tries to cache its 
	findings -- unfortunately its caching is somehow unreliable.
