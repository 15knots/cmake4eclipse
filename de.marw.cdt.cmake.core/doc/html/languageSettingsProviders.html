	<h1>Preprocessor Include Paths, Macros</h1>
	<P>Include paths and preprocessor macros for the C/C++ indexer are supplied by
	<strong>Language Settings Providers</strong> using the
	<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.user/concepts/cdt_c_scanner_discovery.htm">Scanner Discovery</a>
	mechanism. The C/C++/CUDA editors use the C/C++ indexer to improve syntax highlighting, to allow you to jump to
	macro definitions and to browse through include files.
	</P>
	<p>The Cmake4eclipse plugin provides these <strong>Settings Providers</strong>:</p>

	<h3>CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS Parser</h3>
	<p>This provider instructs CMake to generate a file that contains all the compiler command-lines
	which will be executed when a project is build.<br/>
	The plugin will parse that file and feed any preprocessor include path, macro definition or 
	macro undefine that originates from your <em>CMakeLists.txt</em> files to the indexer.<br/>
	Parsing is done rarely, since the internal cache is invalidated only when the
	file`s time-stamp is newer, so it should be reasonably fast.
	</p>
	
	<h3>CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS Compiler Built-ins</h3>
	<p>This provider works similar to <quote>CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS Parser</quote>, but invokes 
	the compiler with arguments to get the include paths and preprocessor macros 
	<strong>built-in to the compiler</strong>.<br/>
	Note thtat this works only for compilers that support this.
	See <a href="builtins-detection.html">built-ins detection</a> for supported compilers.
	</p>
	
	<h3>CMake Build Output Parser (deprecated)</h3>
	<p>
	<strong>Do not use, it will be removed in future versions.</strong> 
	It is just my first implementation of a <code>LanguageSettingsProvider</code>.<br/>
	This provider parses each line of the build output and tries to find compiler command-lines.
	To do so, it instructs CMake to generate build scripts that produce verbose build output.	
	As a cause, it will not work with the <code>ninja</code> build tool, because ninja builds do not print any
	compiler command lines by default.<br/>
	Build output parsing also degrades build performance, so this provider tries to cache its 
	findings -- unfortunately its caching is somehow unreliable.
