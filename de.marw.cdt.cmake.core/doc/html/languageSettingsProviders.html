	<h1>Preprocessor Include Paths, Macros</h1>
	<P>Include paths and preprocessor macros for the CDT source code indexer are supplied by
	<strong>Language Settings Providers</strong> using the
        <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.user/tasks/cdt_t_sd.htm">Scanner Discovery</a>
	mechanism. The C/C++/CUDA editors use the indexer to improve syntax highlighting, allowing you to jump to
	macro definitions and to browse through include files.
	</P>
	<p>The Cmake4eclipse plugin provides two <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.user/concepts/cdt_c_scanner_discovery.htm">Language Settings Providers</a>:</p>

	<h3>CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS Parser</h3>
	<p>This provider instructs CMake to generate a file that contains all the compiler command-lines
	which will be executed when a project is build.<br/>
	The provider will parse that file and feed any preprocessor include path, macro definition or 
	macro undefine that originates from your <em>CMakeLists.txt</em> files to the indexer.<br/>
	Parsing is done rarely, since the internal cache is invalidated only when the
	file`s time-stamp is newer, so it should be reasonably fast.
	</p>
	<h3>CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS Compiler Built-ins</h3>
	<p>This provider works similar to <q>CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS Parser</q>, but invokes 
	the compiler with arguments to get the include paths and preprocessor macros 
	<strong>built-in to the compiler</strong>.<br/>
	Note that this works only for compilers that supporting it.
	See <a href="builtins-detection.html">built-ins detection</a> for supported compilers.
