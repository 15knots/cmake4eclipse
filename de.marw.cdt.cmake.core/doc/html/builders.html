	<h1>Project Builders</h1>
	<p>The CMake for CDT plugin provides the following <strong>Project Builders</strong>. 
	(selectable in the <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.user/reference/cdt_u_prop_build_toolchain.htm">
	Tool Chain Editor tab</a>):</p>

	<h3>CMake Builder (portable)</h3>
	<p>This builder retrieves the name of the build tool from the cache file written
	by cmake during build-script-generation. This approach has some benefits:
	<ul>
  <li>It allows you to build with tools other than <code>make</code>, 
  for example <code>ninja</code>.</li>
  <li>Since cmake does a fairly good job to detect the <strong>absolute</strong> file system path
   of the build tool, you are not forced to put the tool into $PATH.</li>
<li>It makes your Eclipse project being a cross-platform project: Build using make under Linux,
build with MSYS make under windows; without adjusting the Eclipse project files.</li>
</ul>
This is the recommended builder.
	</p>
	
	<h3>CMake Make Builder</h3>
	<p>This builder simply invokes the <code>make</code> command from the executable search
	path ($PATH) to build the project. This builder originates from the original states of this plugin
	and is kept for compatibility reasons only.
