	<h1>Project Builders</h1>
	<p>The CMake for CDT plugin provides the following <strong>Project Builders</strong>
	(selectable in the <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.user/reference/cdt_u_prop_build_toolchain.htm">
	Tool Chain Editor tab</a>):</p>

	<h3 id="portable">CMake Builder (portable)</h3>
	  <p>This builder allows you to customize the build tool to be used on the
    <a href="t_cmake_options_general.html">OS-specific property</a> tabs
    and makes CMake generate the build scripts for the tool of your choice.
  </p>
	<p>The builder retrieves the name of the actual build tool from the cache file written
	by cmake during build-script-generation. It has some benefits compared to the CMake Make Builder:
	<ul>
  <li>It allows you to build with tools other than <code>make</code>, 
  for example <code>ninja</code>, <code>nmake</code> and others.</li>
  <li>You are not forced to put the build tool into $PATH on your machine, since cmake does a fairly good job to
   detect the <strong>absolute</strong> file system path of the build tool.</li>
<li>It makes your Eclipse project being a cross-platform project: You can configure it to build using <code>make</code>
under Linux, and build with <code>MSYS make</code> under windows; without the need to change platform-specifc
 project settings after checkout.</li>
</ul>
This is the recommended builder.
</p>

<h3 id="make">CMake Make Builder</h3>
  <p>
    This builder is nearly identical to the built-in <i>Gnu Make Builder</i>,
    except that it uses the information found in the <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file
    to generate the buildscripts.
    It will always generate makefiles and then simply invoke the <code>make</code> tool
    found in the system's executable search path ($PATH) to build the project.
  </p>
	<p>Please note that this builder originates from the original states of this plugin
	and is kept for compatibility reasons only.
