  <h1>Enabling CMake buildscript generation</h1>
  <p>
    To have your buildscripts generated by cmake, open the <a class="command-link"
      href='javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.project.properties")'>
      <img src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.png"><b>Project&#10146; Properties</b>
    </a> dialog.<br>Expand the <b>C/C++ Build</b> node and click onto <b>Tool
      Chain Editor</b>.<br>On the tool chain editor page, select either <b>CMake
      Make Builder</b> or <b>CMake Builder (portable)</b> as the current builder.
  </p>
  <h2>CMake Make Builder</h2>
  <p>
    This builder is nearly identical to the built-in <i>Gnu Make Builder</i>,
    except that it uses the information found in the <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file
    to generate the buildscripts.
    It will always generate makefiles and then invoke the <code>make</code> tool
    found in the system's executable search path.
  </p>
  <h2>CMake Builder (portable)</h2>
  <p>This builder allows to customize the build tool to be used on the
    <a href="t_cmake_options_general.html">OS-specific property</a> tabs
    and makes CMake generate the build scripts for the tool of choice. In contrast to the
    <i>CMake Make Builder</i>, which is restricted to the <code>make</code> tool, it allows to
    build with <code>make</code>, <code>ninja</code>, <code>nmake</code> and others.<br>
    Since CMake does a fairly good job in detecting the absolute
    file system location of the build tool, the latter can be invoked even if
    it is not on the executable search path.
