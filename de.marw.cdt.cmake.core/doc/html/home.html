  <h2>CMake for CDT User Guide</h2>
  <p>
    CMake for CDT is a plugin that integrates the <a
      href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake</a> cross-platform buildscript
    generator into the C/C++ Development Toolkit (CDT).
  </p>
  <h2>Why CMake for CDT?</h2>
  <p>Blindly invoked, CMake will generate makefiles (or other build scripts)
    inside the source tree, cluttering it with lots of files and directories
    that have to be fleed out from version control: This practice might be ok
    for simple hello-world-projects, but for larger projects, the CMake
    developers recommend You to set up a separate directory for building the
    source.</p>
  <p>
    Annoyingly, these recommended <strong>out-of-source-builds</strong> impose
    some tedious tasks on Your co-workers who check out the code and just want
    to build it:
  <ol>
    <li>leave eclipse workbench,</li>
    <li>manually fire up a command-line shell,</li>
    <li>manually create a directory for the out-of-source-build,</li>
    <li>manually change the CWD to that directory,</li>
    <li>manually invoke cmake, telling it to generate build scripts, which
      kind of build scripts you want and where source source files live,</li>
    <li>re-enter eclipse workbench, configure the checked out project to
      use the generated buildscripts.</li>
  </ol>
  </p>
  <p>CMake for CDT aims to address these tasks: Co-workers can just check
    out the source and have all the tedious tasks automated.</p>
  <h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
	<li>Automatic generation of build scripts. No need to manually invoke <code>cmake</code>.</li>
	<li>Takes your <em>CMakeLists.txt</em> as the source of truth.</li>
	<li>Supports the <code><a href="https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja">ninja</a></code> build system.</li>
	<li>Aims to make Eclipse project cross-platform compatible without the need to change platform-specifc project settings.</li>
	<li>Its Language Settings Provider can feed include paths and pre-processor symbols frrom cmake to the CDT-Indexer.</li>
    </ul>
